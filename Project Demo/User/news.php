    <h2>Awarded Fire Responder of the Year</h2>    
    <p> In Round 4 FY 2022 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) awards, New Hampton FD received a fire grant of $42,914. <br>
    This AFG federal funding will fund 10 complete sets of turnout gear, including:<br>
<ul>
<li> Turnout boots</li><br>
<li>Turnout pants</li><br>
<li>Turnout coats</li><br>
<li>Fire helmets</li><br>
<li>Hoods</li><br>
<li>Gloves</li><br>
</ul>
   





These new pieces replace outdated and obsolete structural turnout gear.<br>

On August 9, 2023, United States Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster (New Hampshire 2nd District), Fire Chief Scott Cathy, and First Responder<br>
 Grants Consultant Greg Bavis joined department personnel and town citizens to celebrate the award and acknowledge the departmentâ€™s work <br>
 protecting the New Hampton community.<br>

As the group gathered, they also got a reminder of how important fire grants such as AFG are. Ten minutes before the meeting started, an emergency<br>
 call came through, and Fire Chief Scott Cathy left to respond.<br>

New Hampton FD now shift to procuring the new turnout gear and putting it into service as soon as possible to answer the new call.<br>
