  <p><li>Keep tea towels and other flammable items away from cookers and hobs.<br></li>
<li>Pull your toaster out from under cupboards before using it and empty the crumb tray after use.<br></li>
<li>Switch off anything you’re not using. <br> </li>
<li>Never put anything metal in the microwave.<br></li>
<li>Always keep an eye on your cooking - never leave anything cooking when you’re out (or asleep).<br></li>
<li>When cooking with oil, use as little as possible. If you are deep-frying,<br> use an electric thermostat-controlled deep-fat fryer rather than deep frying on the hob.<b</li>
<li>Never put water on flames or a smoking pan - it will cause it to explode.<br></li>
